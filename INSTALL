Installation Instructions
*************************

Installation of CitcomS requires the following:

  * A C compiler

  * An MPI library

  * If using Pyre, Python 2.3 or greater (Python 2.4 or greater is required 
    on 64-bit machines), including header files (Python.h).


The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system. 

     Several optional features are disabled by default. Type
     `./configure --help' to list all available options.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

	(if 'configure' is missing, try 'autoreconf --install --force' to create it;
	 and since python is no longer used, config with './configure --with-pyre=no' )
	(If errors about AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR, try aclocal && autoconf && automake --add-missing, see https://earthly.dev/blog/autoconf/)

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

More installation instruction can be found in the manual.
